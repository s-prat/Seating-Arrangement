# Seating-Arrangement

to develop a program to allocate seats to customers purchasing tickets for a movie theatre.
Cinnamon Cinemas provided some criteria for how the program should be built.

#Business Requirements
. The Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre has 15 seats, arranged in 3 rows of 5
Rows are assigned a letter from A to C
Seats are assigned a number from 1 to 5

#User Story
As a Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre Manager
I want to allocate seats to customers
So that I can control reserved seating for the theatre
GIVEN a customer wants to request some tickets
WHEN they request a number of seats between 1 and 3 for a movie
THEN the customer should be allocated the required number of seats
from the available seats on the seating plan
AND the seats should be recorded as allocated

#Acceptance Criteria and Assumptions
Write a program that allocates seats based on a random integer “number of seats” between 1 and 3

Your program should allocate the required number of seats from the available seats starting from seat A1 and filling the auditorium from
left to right, front to back
All of the seats are available for sale when the program starts
The program should continue to allocate a random number of seats until it finds there are not enough seats left to complete the request
Once there are not enough seats available to be allocated then the program can halt
